This repository hosts a small static portfolio website generated by a template. Edit the pages in the repository to reflect your real skills, experience, and projects.

How to customize
- Edit `index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, and `contact.html` to replace placeholders with your real content.
- Update styles in `assets/css/style.css` if you want to change colors or layout.
- Add project screenshots to a new folder `assets/images/` and link them from the project pages.

Publishing
- The repo is already suitable for GitHub Pages. Push changes to the `main` branch and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings if needed.

Need help?
- Reply here with your name, skills, experience, and 2–4 featured projects (title, short description, tech stack, repo/demo links) and I will populate the pages for you.
